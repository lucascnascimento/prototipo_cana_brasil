# prototipo_cana_brasil
A prototype of Cana Brasil's website

This was my first CSS project. At that time I had a friend working at [Cana Brasil](canabrasil.com.br) and they were reshaping their website using WordPress. I was beginning to learn CSS and I decided to make a mockup of it in order to consolidate the new things I was learning. This project was done using nothing but pure CSS.

##Things I Learned

* Flexbox and CSS Grid
* Media queries for creating a responsive web design
* CSS and HTML good practices
